            <h3>Some information about chair</h3>
            <p>
                Chair is ne of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat which is raised up and supported by 4 legs, even some of the chair can have 3 legs and have a different shape.
                Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90°-or-slightly-greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal
                seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support
                the weight of a person who sits on the seat.
